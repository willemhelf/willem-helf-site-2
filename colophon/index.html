          This website was made with pure CSS and HTML, with occasional JavaScript if you know where to look. I use <span class="bolded">VSCode</span> to write out my code, <span class="bolded">iTerm</span> to manage my files, and <span class="bolded">Dreamhost</span> to host them on the web. If I want to edit something I simply edit the file itself and re-upload it.
