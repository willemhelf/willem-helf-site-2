        Despite several years of using many different web development tools as a software engineer, I have always enjoyed having a very lightweight personal website that is lovingly made by hand. This website was made using plain HTML and CSS, with a little bit of vanilla JavaScript here and there. I may at one point implement a p5.js feature, but I'm still thinking about it.

        For this site I used VSCode to write out my HTML and CSS, iTerm to manage my files, and Dreamhost to host them on the web. If I want to edit something I simply edit the file itself and re-upload it.

        This site does not track your data in any way. There are no site metrics because I do not care about that sort of thing.
