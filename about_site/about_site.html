            Despite several years of using many different web development tools as a software engineer, I have always enjoyed having a very lightweight personal website that is lovingly made by hand. In fact, building a simple website is how I first became interested in coding as a whole: in 2015, I wanted a customizable website to host my art on, and soon realized that true customization begins in a simple HTML file.

            Previous iterations of this website have been more strictly professional, but I hope this version can grow and shift into whatever I feel like turning it into over time. It is nice to have one's own little corner of the web, and ideally I will take the time to play with this one, trying out new tools and adding new pages as I feel like it.

            On the front page of this site there is a small timestamp of when it was last updated. Hopefully it changes frequently!
