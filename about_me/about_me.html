        I received a BA (Honors) in Graphic Design from Central Saint Martins in 2015, worked as a graphic designer and software engineer for a while, and am
        now a first-year student on the <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/information/library-and-information-science/" target="_blank">MSLIS</a> program at Pratt Institute with the intent to focus on digital humanities.

        My CV is not very interesting, but I've never felt like very much of a "professional" or "careerist" sort of person to begin with. That being said, it would be nice to someday be able to put "teacher" or "curator" or "artist" on my resume. We'll see! For now, I am enjoying being in school.
